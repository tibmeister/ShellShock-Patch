ShellShock-Patch
================

Script to manuall patch the ShellShock BASH vulnerability.  This can be run on all OSes and uses BASH (a small bit of irony).

This basically goes out to the master BASH code repository, grabs the source and ALL patches and applies them.  IT then replaces the existing /bin/bash with a new and patched one.
